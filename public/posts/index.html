ive spent my nights twisting and turning over how one moment you&rsquo;re there and the next you&rsquo;re just not. the sheets are all hot and horrible now and still understanding alludes me.
how wrong this is. to leave no mark in the sand, no note on the fridge, no reason why.
maybe a fool would see the long trail of sand that had been drudged through for years and scratch his head at it&rsquo;s end. </p>

There are certain movies that stick with you; La Haine is certainly one of them. Since I saw the movie for the first time last week, it hasn&rsquo;t left my mind. </p>

                My old code sucks

        <p class="line-summary"> Hi everyone! For the past week or so I&rsquo;ve been revisiting an old project of mine called Skely, which is a tool I wrote to help use and manage project templates (a.k.a. skeletons). The last time I touched the project was right over a year ago, around when I first started learning rust, so the code quality was not great. Since then, I&rsquo;ve become an much much better developer and I want to look at some of my old code, look at the new code, and analyze why the new code is better. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> Hi everyone, welcome to my website. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to make a website for a long time, but I&rsquo;ve always struggled with making something that&rsquo;s both good looking and functional as I&rsquo;m not much of a frontend guy. Because of my general lack of interest in the frontend world, I had no idea that static site generators (SSGs) existed, which make the entire process of creating a website an order of magnitude easier. </p>
