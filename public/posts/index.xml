      <description>i dont think ill ever fully understand it.&#xA;ive spent my nights twisting and turning over how one moment you&amp;rsquo;re there and the next you&amp;rsquo;re just not. the sheets are all hot and horrible now and still understanding alludes me.&#xA;how wrong this is. to leave no mark in the sand, no note on the fridge, no reason why.&#xA;maybe a fool would see the long trail of sand that had been drudged through for years and scratch his head at it&amp;rsquo;s end.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked&amp;hellip; I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.</description>

      <description>“Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good&amp;hellip; so far so good&amp;hellip; so far so good. How you fall doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s how you land!”&#xA;There are certain movies that stick with you; La Haine is certainly one of them. Since I saw the movie for the first time last week, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t left my mind.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! For the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting an old project of mine called Skely, which is a tool I wrote to help use and manage project templates (a.k.a. skeletons). The last time I touched the project was right over a year ago, around when I first started learning rust, so the code quality was not great. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve become an much much better developer and I want to look at some of my old code, look at the new code, and analyze why the new code is better.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, welcome to my website. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make a website for a long time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled with making something that&amp;rsquo;s both good looking and functional as I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a frontend guy. Because of my general lack of interest in the frontend world, I had no idea that static site generators (SSGs) existed, which make the entire process of creating a website an order of magnitude easier.</description>
