    <p>i dont think ill ever fully understand it.<br>
<br>
ive spent my nights twisting and turning over how <br>
one moment you&rsquo;re there and the next you&rsquo;re just not. <br>
the sheets are all hot and horrible now and still understanding alludes me.<br>
<br>
how wrong this is. to leave no mark in the sand, no note on the fridge, no reason why.<br>
maybe a fool would see the long trail of sand that had been drudged through for years and scratch his head at it&rsquo;s end.<br>
maybe i&rsquo;ve been made a fool.<br>
<br>
death makes what it wants of me.<br>
my notebook of coping strategies and meditations does me no good in the face of the great equalizer.<br>
its very loud at first. it comes at you screaming and kicking; crying &ldquo;how could it be&rdquo;.<br>
shock subsides.<br>
someone will tell you &ldquo;the number 12 is everywhere&rdquo; and it will feel as if the number 12 is haunting you.<br>
you&rsquo;ll see it everywhere- buses, milk cartons, the time.<br>
every turn of every corner of your day will find some cruel way to remind you of what you&rsquo;ve lost.<br>
a photo, or an odd possession of theirs might be expected to stir up some feelings,<br>
but it sneaks into where you least expect it.<br>
a song, a color, a face, a phrase that knocks the wind out of you as if the number 12 had learned muay thai.<br>
and all of the sudden you&rsquo;re back at the start.<br>
<br>
where was i<br>
where was i when it happened<br>
what was i doing<br>
what could i have done<br>
why did she do it<br>
why why why<br>
<br>
maybe she&rsquo;s happier now. maybe it truly was too much to bear.<br>
but what could it have been that she had to bear it alone?<br>
the weight of the world was never meant just for her, why did she insist upon holding it?<br>
we were all here.<br>
<br>
the world has been robbed of its kindness and its beauty.<br>
it seems shes taken it all with her<br>
and left us.<br>
<br>
every memory, every moment, every photo is a reminder of how half of that story ends. how her story ended.<br>
to look at a childhood photo and know what the you then didnt.<br>
to know you&rsquo;d be speaking at her funeral in 10 years.<br>
<br>
we were close back then, but we faded apart.<br>
when i got to high school we reconnected, and the kindness she extended towards me changed my life.<br>
it wasn&rsquo;t huge, but it was unconditional. i didn&rsquo;t even love myself unconditionally.<br>
even for a small moment, i got to experience the kindness she had grown into.<br>
we grew apart again when she went to college, which is fine. i don&rsquo;t blame either of us for falling out of touch.<br>
i wish i had texted just once.<br>
<br>
i knew the depth of the person we were mourning that day. i understood it.<br>
i felt a certain guilt being a speaker amongst her two best friends and her aunt, <br>
but every word of their loving recollections felt all too familiar for me to be a stranger.<br>
<br>
she saw people for who they really are<br>
<br>
that one stuck in my head for the entire service.<br>
what a wonderful gift. <br>
to understand people. <br>
and at that to understand them more than theyd like you to.<br>
to understand who they are<br>
not who they say they are<br>
<br>
she certainly understood me for who i was<br>
underneath all those layers of embarassingly baggy clothes<br>
and embarassingly smudged eyeliner<br>
she understood me<br>
<br>
i wish she knew how much that meant to me.<br>
i wish i could tell her.<br>
<br>
i love you so much<br>
thank you for being you<br>
you were always enough<br>
<br>
i dont know what i could&rsquo;ve said to change her mind<br>
i dont think im qualified to even brainstorm<br>
but i know i wish she didn&rsquo;t<br>
ive wished so hard; harder than i ever have, for longer than i ever have.<br>
its been days and weeks<br>
and it will be months and years and decades of wishing and wishing<br>
my 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s will come and go and <br>
i will still be wishing that kind, sweet girl i grew up with was still around to talk<br>
<br>
maybe by then i wouldve gotten to know her again<br>
thats what stings the most<br>
i didnt know her<br>
i didnt know who shed grown into<br>
<br>
i knew her<br>
thats it<br>
now thats it<br>
<br>
i find myself mourning the amazing person she grew into<br>
the amazing person that touched the lives of all three hundred people in that church<br>
a feat im certain the 10 year old i was acquainted with was under-equipped for<br>
<br>
no, no<br>
she was so much more than i ever knew<br>
<br>
i find myself mourning the person i never got to know<br>
<br>
it feels wrong<br>
it feels dirty<br>
like a trick has been played on me<br>
<br>
a certain eventually has been taken without any warning<br>
maybe it was my fault for it being an eventually<br>
why wasn&rsquo;t it just a now<br>
<br>
maybe that check in wouldve done it<br>
maybe she wouldve thought not tonight<br>
maybe she wouldve been just distracted enough with our memories together<br>
i know just how distracting they are now<br>
<br>
the worst part<br>
and i mean the worst part<br>
<br>
she doesnt know<br>
she certainly didnt think about me in those last moments<br>
or any of those other people in the church bar a few<br>
she didnt picture me standing up there, <br>
shaking as i read a sorry substitue for the words i wish i had told her<br>
she didnt picture the tears, the screams, the absent staring into space for weeks on end<br>
of every single person in that room.<br>
<br>
yet here i am writing about it.<br>
crying through my fingers into my keyboard because tears wouldnt come close to enough.<br>
so many people cared so much about her.<br>
i wish she had known; maybe things would be different.<br>
<br>
i walked up onto the stand with my speech on my phone. <br>
ive never been a poor public speaker, but up there it all hit me<br>
the gravity, the grief, the realness, it was all there in that church air<br>
staring at me<br>
<br>
i started my speech.<br>
<br>
people laughed<br>
people cried<br>
<br>
as i approached the end, the emotion overtook me.<br>
i couldnt do it<br>
it was too much<br>
i couldnt accept it in front of everyone<br>
i didnt want it to be real<br>
<br>
i looked in her moms eyes<br>
my aunt, as i called her<br>
<br>
i had been avoiding making eye contact. i had been a coward<br>
the pain that she must have been going through is unimaginable<br>
i was afraid that even eye contact would make me burst into tears<br>
<br>
but when i looked in her eyes<br>
i saw so much love<br>
for her daughter<br>
that had been taken too soon from her<br>
but it was love that was unpersuaded to let the footnote overtake the story<br>
love that was unerased by grief<br>
love that was unbothered by physical presence<br>
love that saw her daughters presence in the lives of anyone who had been touched by her kindness.<br>
love that told me to continue<br>
to not let my grief stop me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->i love you grace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so i ask of you this
just as you extend it unto others<br>
please<br>
please</p>
<p>please<br>
give yourself patience<br>
give yourself kindness<br>
give yourself compassion<br>
give yourself grace</p>
<p>-lucas</p>
