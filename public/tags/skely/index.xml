      <description>Hi everyone! For the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting an old project of mine called Skely, which is a tool I wrote to help use and manage project templates (a.k.a. skeletons). The last time I touched the project was right over a year ago, around when I first started learning rust, so the code quality was not great. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve become an much much better developer and I want to look at some of my old code, look at the new code, and analyze why the new code is better.</description>
