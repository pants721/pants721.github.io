Hey! I'm Lucas; welcome to my website. This is the main place you can find my info, as well as [my ramblings](/posts) 
about politics, philosophy, tech, and more.

I'm a computer science nerd, particularly when it comes to **AI**, **programming languages**, and **systems programming**.
I write most of my software in Rust, C, and Python, but I'm familiar with Java, C++, Typescript, and Go. If you want to check out some of my projects, you can find them [on this site](/projects) or [Github](https://github.com/pants721).

Outside of computer science, I have a frankly overwhelming amount of interests. I love writing, philosophy, volleyball, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and video games.
