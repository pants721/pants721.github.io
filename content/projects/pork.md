I started programming to write reset macros for Minecraft speedrunning. This 
was sort of my keystone project in my initial journey into coding. Pork 
basically aimed to automate the reset process based off of blue pixels that 
indicate an ocean. This was more of a proof-of-concept as all auto-resetting 
was illegal and there are some nuances in how an actual model should detect 
beaches (more than just blue pixels). Still, this was my first real project in 
rust and thus holds a special place in my hear.
