I wrote lin in my quest to become one of those guys on twitter bragging about
how they "implemented machine learning in C", but in its development, I 
unironically gained a much better understanding of the underlying math behind 
machine learning. Really fun project. Took about two weeks. 

Using arrays in C is a nightmare. Even implementing dynamic arrays doesn't 
solve much. I also learned that C is not ergonomic for things like machine 
learning and math.
