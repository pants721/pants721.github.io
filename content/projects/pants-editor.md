I am a terminal editor-hopper. I started on VSCode, like everyone, but the 
sweet sound of neovim called to me and I defected. I used neovim for about two
years, but then I started watching this Youtuber called Tsoding. He's really 
entertaining and a good educator in programming. However, he's an Emacs user,
which was sacrilegious to a neovim user like myself. But his workflow was so 
fast and efficient, and the idea of a standalone, light-weight, GUI editor was
appealling to me as I'd grown tired of the terminal. However, I would learn 
that Emacs is anything but lightweight. I had a number of problems with it and 
stopped using Emacs after about a year.

I decided that I would go back to neovim, but start developing my own text 
editor on the side to fit my needs. Although Pants Editor is essentially nano
as of now, I predict that by 2093 I will have fully implemented vim macros.
