i think im just a haunted house in my worst moments.
the lights are flashing; the wood is creaky
and theres always ghosts. its always ghosts.
every single time, they surround me screaming 
until im on the floor; deafened.

i wish i could tell you who the ghosts are
maybe then we could talk it out
but they have no face
or if they did, it's been long forgotten
the only thing to remember them by is fear

its not just any fear.
its a protective fear
it doesnt feel like fear in the moment
it feels like survival

in the moment its logical
ive faced this threat before
i know this attack pattern

i throw the jabs i learned the times before.
a quick liver shot will shut any ghost down.
ive won!

the lights turn on. its just a house now.
there were no ghosts; there never were any.
but i saw them. i swear i saw them.
i know i saw them.

but its okay. its whatever.
whats wrong with some sloppy shadow boxing in a dark room?
but someones keeled over in front of me.
someone i love ate that liver shot.

its okay i was just defending myself.
i was just defending myself.
i mean how could i not? 
there were fucking ghosts man.

but none of that really matters to them
i mean obviously they just got punched they dont care
but you need them to know about the ghosts
there were ghosts!

but this isnt the first time.
i shouldve learned last time.
the writing on the wall is in blood
"ITS NOT REAL"
i can see it now with clarity.

thats what i hate about ghosts man.
they always leave me worse 
they always leave me hurting others
they always leave me questioning

is this really my house?
did i really do that?
i thought i was winning
this doesnt feel like winning

the worst part 
that you only realize after 
is that the ghosts dont haunt you
they are you

everything that makes you *you*
is what made the ghosts ghosts
you are creations of the same factory
atoms of the same element

maybe the haunted house metaphor is contrived
it abstracts away that core truth of all these issues
they are me and i am them

that wasnt me.
i mean, yes, i know that was me.
but thats not who i am.

jekyll is not hyde just becuase they share skin.
that was someone else.

but consequences dont care about the ghosts that haunt you.
you chose to enter the haunted house.
you chose to *be* the house.
