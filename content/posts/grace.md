i dont think ill ever fully understand it.

ive spent my nights twisting and turning over how 
one moment you're there and the next you're just not. 
the sheets are all hot and horrible now and still understanding alludes me.

how wrong this is. to leave no mark in the sand, no note on the fridge, no reason why.
maybe a fool would see the long trail of sand that had been drudged through for years and scratch his head at it's end.
maybe i've been made a fool.

death makes what it wants of me.
my notebook of coping strategies and meditations does me no good in the face of the great equalizer.
its very loud at first. it comes at you screaming and kicking; crying "how could it be".
shock subsides.
someone will tell you "the number 12 is everywhere" and it will feel as if the number 12 is haunting you.
you'll see it everywhere- buses, milk cartons, the time.
every turn of every corner of your day will find some cruel way to remind you of what you've lost.
a photo, or an odd possession of theirs might be expected to stir up some feelings,
but it sneaks into where you least expect it.
a song, a color, a face, a phrase that knocks the wind out of you as if the number 12 had learned muay thai.
and all of the sudden you're back at the start.

where was i
where was i when it happened
what was i doing
what could i have done
why did she do it
why why why

maybe she's happier now. maybe it truly was too much to bear.
but what could it have been that she had to bear it alone?
the weight of the world was never meant just for her, why did she insist upon holding it?
we were all here.

the world has been robbed of its kindness and its beauty.
it seems shes taken it all with her
and left us.

every memory, every moment, every photo is a reminder of how half of that story ends. how her story ended.
to look at a childhood photo and know what the you then didnt.
to know you'd be speaking at her funeral in 10 years.

we were close back then, but we faded apart.
when i got to high school we reconnected, and the kindness she extended towards me changed my life.
it wasn't huge, but it was unconditional. i didn't even love myself unconditionally.
even for a small moment, i got to experience the kindness she had grown into.
we grew apart again when she went to college, which is fine. i don't blame either of us for falling out of touch.
i wish i had texted just once.

i knew the depth of the person we were mourning that day. i understood it.
i felt a certain guilt being a speaker amongst her two best friends and her aunt, 
but every word of their loving recollections felt all too familiar for me to be a stranger.

she saw people for who they really are

that one stuck in my head for the entire service.
what a wonderful gift. 
to understand people. 
and at that to understand them more than theyd like you to.
to understand who they are
not who they say they are

she certainly understood me for who i was
underneath all those layers of embarassingly baggy clothes
and embarassingly smudged eyeliner
she understood me

i wish she knew how much that meant to me.
i wish i could tell her.

i love you so much
thank you for being you
you were always enough

i dont know what i could've said to change her mind
i dont think im qualified to even brainstorm
but i know i wish she didn't
ive wished so hard; harder than i ever have, for longer than i ever have.
its been days and weeks
and it will be months and years and decades of wishing and wishing
my 30's and 40's will come and go and 
i will still be wishing that kind, sweet girl i grew up with was still around to talk

maybe by then i wouldve gotten to know her again
thats what stings the most
i didnt know her
i didnt know who shed grown into

i knew her
thats it
now thats it

i find myself mourning the amazing person she grew into
the amazing person that touched the lives of all three hundred people in that church
a feat im certain the 10 year old i was acquainted with was under-equipped for

no, no
she was so much more than i ever knew

i find myself mourning the person i never got to know

it feels wrong
it feels dirty
like a trick has been played on me

a certain eventually has been taken without any warning
maybe it was my fault for it being an eventually
why wasn't it just a now

maybe that check in wouldve done it
maybe she wouldve thought not tonight
maybe she wouldve been just distracted enough with our memories together
i know just how distracting they are now

the worst part
and i mean the worst part

she doesnt know
she certainly didnt think about me in those last moments
or any of those other people in the church bar a few
she didnt picture me standing up there, 
shaking as i read a sorry substitue for the words i wish i had told her
she didnt picture the tears, the screams, the absent staring into space for weeks on end
of every single person in that room.

yet here i am writing about it.
crying through my fingers into my keyboard because tears wouldnt come close to enough.
so many people cared so much about her.
i wish she had known; maybe things would be different.

i walked up onto the stand with my speech on my phone. 
ive never been a poor public speaker, but up there it all hit me
the gravity, the grief, the realness, it was all there in that church air
staring at me

i started my speech.

people laughed
people cried

as i approached the end, the emotion overtook me.
i couldnt do it
it was too much
i couldnt accept it in front of everyone
i didnt want it to be real

i looked in her moms eyes
my aunt, as i called her

i had been avoiding making eye contact. i had been a coward
the pain that she must have been going through is unimaginable
i was afraid that even eye contact would make me burst into tears

but when i looked in her eyes
i saw so much love
for her daughter
that had been taken too soon from her
but it was love that was unpersuaded to let the footnote overtake the story
love that was unerased by grief
love that was unbothered by physical presence
love that saw her daughters presence in the lives of anyone who had been touched by her kindness.
love that told me to continue
to not let my grief stop me

> "<span style="color: purple;">i love you grace</span>"

so i ask of you this
just as you extend it unto others
please
please

please
give yourself patience
give yourself kindness
give yourself compassion
give yourself grace
